### Plan for 4 days:

📌 Day 2 ➝ We register in Jira, continue working with our Test Cases and create an Error Report based on them.
📌 Day 3 ➝ We are testing how we perform as real testers and receive notifications with user errors. You will need to test each of them and create an Error Report.
📌 Day 4 ➝ Final webinar (duration - 1,5 hour), where we will live recap the marathon and talk in detail about the transition to IT as a QA engineer
