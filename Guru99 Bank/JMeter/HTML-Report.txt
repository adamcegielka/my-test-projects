This document has errors that must be fixed before
using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version.
You may need to move one or both of the <form> and </form>
tags. HTML elements should be properly nested and form elements
are no exception. For instance you should not place the <form>
in one table cell and the </form> in another. If the <form> is
placed before a table, the </form> cannot be placed inside the
table! Note that one form can't be nested inside another!
The table summary attribute should be used to describe
the table structure. It is very helpful for people using
non-visual browsers. The scope and headers attributes for
table cells are useful for specifying which headers apply
to each table cell, enabling non-visual browsers to provide
a meaningful context for each cell.
The alt attribute should be used to give a short description
of an image; longer descriptions should be given with the
longdesc attribute which takes a URL linked to the description.
These measures are needed for people using non-graphical browsers.
