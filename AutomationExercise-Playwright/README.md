## Tools used for testing

I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to create the automated tests and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to run them with language [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Test results
I will describe the results of the tests once all the tests have been completed

## Conclusions
I will describe a summary of the entire project once all the tests have been completed
