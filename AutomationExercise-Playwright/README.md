# Automation Exercise with Playwright 

## The objective of the test project

The objective of my testing project is to create automated tests for the [Automation Exercise](https://automationexercise.com/) application in order to gain valuable experience in automated testing. 

## Scope of the test project

The test project involves running automated tests using a ready-made test [Scenario](https://automationexercise.com/test_cases?fbclid=IwAR2ouXOIt6YlG3ew40mb-bogyiXDe8BTQQNfagn0q8EEI6JYdnE6EhHrqjU)  and  [API testing](https://automationexercise.com/api_list) in Automation.

## Tools used for testing

I will use [TestRail](https://www.testrail.com/) to write the test cases and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to create the automated tests and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to run them with language [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I will also use other tools such as [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) to report bugs, [PicPick](https://picpick.app/) to take scans and [DevTools]().

## Test results
I will describe the results of the tests once all the tests have been completed

## Conclusions
I will describe a summary of the entire project once all the tests have been completed
